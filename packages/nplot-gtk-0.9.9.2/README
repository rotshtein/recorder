The first version of NPlot-Gtk was made by Miguel de Icaza, and was 
a NPlot 0.9.8.5 wrapper.

Now the version 0.9.9.2 wrapper is just an upgrade and 
a few hacks over the work of Miguel (Carlos Ble)

------------------------

This version of NPlot has been extended to support Gtk# on Linux.

The version is based on NPlot 0.9.9.2

To build, type `make'

The Gtk# demo is in lib/mf.exe and lib/test.exe

Notice that you must include in your distirbution not only the .dll
files, but also the .config files.
